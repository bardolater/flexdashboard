# flexdashboard
##This is an example of how to create a simple interactive visualization with flexdashboard. The user will need to use the file "dashboardfile", which is designed to be an R Markdown file that is added to a flexdashboard template. The dashboard file uses the csv file, and the user will need to update the path.
