# Intro {.sidebar}
This dashboard is an example of how to use flexdashboard for a simple, online data visualization.

For this visualization, I used 297 institutions' data from IPEDS (the 2015 data surveys). All were doctorate-granting institutions with total enrollments of at least 10,000. Although AAU status is reported, only 55 AAU schools were included in this analysis. 

The line plots are interactive and by hovering over the points, you can see specific information for a school. 

# Student Success

## Column 1

### Graduation Rate over Retention Rate (by AAU Status)
``` {r echo=FALSE}
a <- read.csv("~/ipeds_reduced.csv", header=TRUE)
b <- a[which(a$grad_rate != 0), ]

UD_grad <- b[which(b$School == "University of Delaware"),]

  
c_grad <- list(
    x = UD_grad$Retention,
    y = UD_grad$grad_rate,
    text = "UD",
    xref = "x",
    yref = "y",
    showarrow = TRUE,
    arrowhead = 7,
    ax = -20,
    ay = -40
)

#make the data frames and loess regression for adding the lines
aau.grad <- b[which(b$AAU_SCHOOL == "AAU"),]
non.aau.grad <-b[which(b$AAU_SCHOOL == "NON-AAU"),]
aau.grad.loess <- loess(grad_rate ~ Retention, span = 0.75, se = TRUE, data=aau.grad)
aau.grad$y.loess <- predict(aau.grad.loess, aau.grad)

#aau.grad.fitted <- lm(grad_rate ~ Retention, data=aau.grad)
non.aau.grad.loess <- loess(grad_rate ~ Retention, span = 0.75, data=non.aau.grad)
non.aau.grad$y.loess <- predict(non.aau.grad.loess, non.aau.grad)


p_grad <- plot_ly(
  b, x = ~Retention, y = ~grad_rate,
  text = ~paste("School: ", School, "<br>Grad Rate: ", grad_rate, "<br>Retention Rate: ", Retention), color = ~AAU_SCHOOL, colors = c("orange", "blue"))%>%
    add_markers()%>%
    add_lines(data = aau.grad, x = ~Retention, y = ~y.loess, mode="line", showlegend = FALSE, hoverinfo='none') %>%
    add_lines(data = non.aau.grad, x = ~Retention, y = ~y.loess, mode="line", showlegend = FALSE, hoverinfo='none') %>%
    layout(title = "<b>Plot of 6-yr Graduation Rate over Retention Rate (with label for UD point)",
           annotations = c_grad,
           xaxis = list(title = "<b>Retention Rate", range = c(0,102), showspikes = TRUE),
           yaxis = list(title = "<b>6-yr Graduation Rate", range = c(0,102), showspikes = TRUE))
p_grad
